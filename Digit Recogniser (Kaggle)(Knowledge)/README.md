# Digit Recogniser
This data science project that will enable me to grasp the basics needed predict outcomes from an established set.

## Background
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision.
Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms.
As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks.
We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.

## Opportunity
With this project we want to gain the fundamentals of data analysis, by analysing the factors that determined whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.

## Libraries
There is significant use of NumPy, Pandas, TFLearn for Neural Network Classifier and Data Visualization Libraries.

## Approach
My solution will take the following shape: 

- Modeling 
- Model fine-tuning

## Ranking/Score
