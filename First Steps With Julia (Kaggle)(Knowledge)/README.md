# First Steps With Julia
This data science project that will enable me to grasp the basics needed predict outcomes from an established set.

## Background
This competition is designed to help you get started with Julia. If you are looking for a good programming language for data science,
or if you are already accustomed to one language, we encourage you to also try Julia.
Julia is a relatively new language for technical computing that attempts to combine the strengths of other popular programming languages.
