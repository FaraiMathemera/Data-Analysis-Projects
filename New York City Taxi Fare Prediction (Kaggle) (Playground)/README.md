# New York City Taxi Fare Prediction
This data science project that will enable me to grasp the basics needed to gain insights from data sets and predict outcomes, using a kernel because of the size of the data set.

## Background
In this playground competition, hosted in partnership with Google Cloud and Coursera, you are tasked with predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations.
While you can get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an RMSE of $5-$8, depending on the model used (see the starter code for an example of this approach in Kernels).
Your challenge is to do better than this using Machine Learning techniques!

## Opportunity
With this project we want to gain the fundamentals of data analysis, by analysing the factors that determined whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.

## Libraries
There is significant use of NumPy, Pandas, SciKit Learn for Neural Network Classifier and Data Visualization Libraries.

## Approach
My solution will take the shape of a typical data science project: 

- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Modeling 
- Model fine-tuning

## Score/Ranking
