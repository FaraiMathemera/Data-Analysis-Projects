# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
This data science project that will enable me to grasp the basics needed predict outcomes from an established set.

## Background
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad.
But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Opportunity
With this project we want to gain the fundamentals of data analysis, by analysing the factors that determined whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.

## Libraries
There is significant use of NumPy, Pandas, TFLearn for Neural Network Classifier and Data Visualization Libraries.

## Approach
My solution will take the shape of a typical data science project: 

- Modeling 
- Model fine-tuning
