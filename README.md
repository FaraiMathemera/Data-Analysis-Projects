# Data-Analysis-Projects (Kaggle)
Collection of data analysis projects that I have done in order to improve my skills and for general insight into interesting topics.

## Approach
The general approach I will employ will be:

- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Modeling 
- Model fine-tuning

## Libraries
I am new to data science and have only used a handful of libraries for modelling which have been useful with these problems.

-Tensorflow
-KNN
-SciKit Learn
-

## Rankings
I joined Kaggle recently and have realized not to take the rankings too heart, I believe Kaggle is an unbelievable platform which 
I can use to gain exposure to various data sets, modelling and validation approaches used in the data science community.
